# ðŸª¨ Stone Throwing System - FIXED!

## âœ… Issues Resolved

### **Problem**: Stone throwing system not working properly
- After using stone from inventory, no text appeared saying stone was ready
- Pressing A key after using stone did nothing
- Stone throw mode was not being activated

### **Root Cause**: Missing inventory connection
The inventory system was being recreated in `start_game()` method without connecting it to the game instance, breaking the stone throwing activation.

### **Solution Applied**:

#### 1. **Fixed Inventory Connection** (main.py line 590)
```python
# Before (BROKEN):
self.inventory = Inventory()
self.visual_feedback = VisualFeedback()

# After (FIXED):
self.inventory = Inventory()
self.inventory.game_instance = self  # Connect for item effects
self.visual_feedback = VisualFeedback()
```

#### 2. **Added Error Handling** (game_systems.py)
```python
# Safe visual feedback call
if hasattr(self.game_instance, 'visual_feedback') and self.game_instance.visual_feedback:
    self.game_instance.visual_feedback.show_message("ðŸŽ¯ Stone ready! Press A to throw!", 3.0)
```
