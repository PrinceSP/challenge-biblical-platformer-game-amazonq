### **🎯 Technical Implementation Success**

#### **Dialogue Text Rendering**
```python
# Text appears immediately in dialogue box
self.displayed_text = self.current_node.text  # Show text immediately
self.waiting_for_input = True  # Ready for input immediately

# Proper text rendering with golden borders
pygame.draw.rect(screen, (40, 30, 20), panel_rect)  # Brown background
pygame.draw.rect(screen, (218, 165, 32), panel_rect, 4)  # Golden border
line_surface = font_manager.render_text(line, 'small', WHITE)
screen.blit(line_surface, (panel_rect.left + 20, panel_rect.top + y_offset))
```

#### **Event Handling**
```python
# SPACE/ENTER advances dialogue
if event.key in [pygame.K_SPACE, pygame.K_RETURN]:
    if self.waiting_for_input:
        # Advance to next dialogue or end
        self.active = False  # End dialogue and return to gameplay

# ESC provides emergency exit
elif event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
    self.active = False  # Skip dialogue
```

#### **Debug Information**
```python
# Confirms text is loaded and displayed
print(f"🎭 Speaker: {self.current_node.speaker}")
print(f"🎭 Full text: {self.full_text[:50]}...")
